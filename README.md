## An alternative front-end for Instagram.

Bibliogram works without client-side JavaScript, has no ads or tracking, and doesn't urge you to sign up.

## Instances

The official instance is on https://bibliogram.art.

You can see a list of instances run by the community [on the wiki page](https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram/wiki/Instances).

If you only use one computer, you can install Bibliogram on that computer and then access the instance through localhost.

## Installing

Quick setup, if you've run webservers before:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (^12.13.0 suggested)
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram`  
If you are using a fork, be sure to actually install that fork instead!
1. `$ cd bibliogram`
1. `$ npm install --no-optional` (for Tor support, omit `--no-optional`)
1. Edit `/config.js` to suit your server environment
1. `$ npm start`

Bibliogram is now running on `0.0.0.0:10407`.

After installing, you _must_ configure `website_origin`. See [Wiki:Installing](https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram/wiki/Installing) and [Wiki:Configuring](https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram/wiki/Configuring) for more details. Problems? [Wiki:Troubleshooting](https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram/wiki/Troubleshooting)

You can also deploy on Heroku, though I personally would not recommend this. [Get started with Heroku.](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram)
